\subsection{Operating System Specific}
\label{sec:os}

So far, engine supports only Windows system. Due to the among others poor support of VR devices on Linux system.
Further explained in the section with \hyperref[sec:problems]{problems which we have met during the development}.
Every OS specific implementations should be specified inside \texttt{./engine/src/os/[os]/} with declarations at \texttt{./engine/src/os/[os]/os.h}.\\.cpp
For compilation only are added \texttt{.cpp} files only from interested operating system, the same applies to headers, especially \texttt{os.h} that existence is required and from which the engine takes OS specific staff.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++, caption=Windows OS Header(./engine/src/os/win32/os.h)]
#define LIBRARY_TYPE HMODULE
#define LoadFunction GetProcAddress

class Win32Window final : public Window
{
public:
    Win32Window(const std::string_view windowName, const size_t width, const size_t height)
        : Window{windowName, width, height}
    {}
    ~Win32Window();

    HINSTANCE getHInstance() const { return mHInstance; }
    HWND getHwnd() const { return mHwnd; }

    void show() override;
    Message peekMessage() override;
    void dispatchMessage() override;

private:
    static LRESULT windowProcedure(HWND pHwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM pWParam, LPARAM wLParam);

    HINSTANCE mHInstance{};
    HWND mHwnd{};
    MSG mMsg{};

    void createWindow() override;
};
\end{lstlisting}

So far, in the \texttt{os.h} header, obligatory to make engine working is to define \texttt{LIBRARY\_TYPE} and \texttt{LoadFunction} preprocessor definitions for \hyperref[sec:vkLoader]{Vulkan Loader}, and \texttt{Window} class that creates window and handles user actions using interface's methods, in the case of Windows using Win32 API.\\
Unfortunately, it's not possible to close everything in one header file, therefore for an instance, object of \texttt{Window} class must be created inside \texttt{std::shared\_ptr<Window> Window::createWindowInstance(const std::string\_view windowName, const size\_t width, const size\_t height)};.
How despite testing only one OS we provided an architecture possible to grow on other platforms is explained in
\hyperref[sec:build_specfic]{Building OS Specific} section.
