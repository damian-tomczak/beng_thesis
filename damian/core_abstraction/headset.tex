\subsubsection{Headset with Controllers}
\label{sec:headset}
OpenXR specific staff is handled by classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Headset}\\
    \item \texttt{MirrorView}\\
    \item \texttt{Controllers}\\
    Controllers abstraction provides a basic layer of abstraction over OpenXR control devices. 
\end{itemize}
