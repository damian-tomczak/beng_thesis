\subsection{TSEngine Internal Core Abstraction}
\hspace{\parindent} Internal TSEngine Core covers \hyperref[sec:renderer]{\ref*{sec:renderer} Renderer} and \hyperref[sec:headset]{\ref*{sec:headset} Headset with Controllers} abstraction, there is one place where these two things share the same encapsulation, this thing is \texttt{Context} class.\\
All of them are available in the corresponding files \texttt{*.cpp} and \texttt{*.h} files inside \texttt{./engine/src/core/} path]\\
The main purpose of \texttt{Context} class is creation of OpenXR and Vulkan instances. So it means that Khronos structures are initialized within this class, when usually there is no reason to re-initialized them after creation of the app and used widely through the app, such structures objects are: \texttt{VkPhysicalDevice}, \texttt{VkDevice}, \texttt{VkQueue}, or \texttt{XrSystemId}. And also \texttt{Context} sets up multisampling and uniform buffer alignment. This is not the end as \texttt{Context} creates and sets up debug messengers.
It's worth to point out that Context also loading Vulkan functions with the help of \hyperref[sec:vkLoader]{\ref*{sec:vkLoader} Vulkan Loader}, unfortunately we didn't have time to provide our own OpenXR loader.\\
I see here a field of improvement as it can be accessible through singleton pattern
\footnote{The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.}.
